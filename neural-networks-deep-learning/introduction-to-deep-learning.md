## Introduction to Deep Learning

1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?
+ *AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.*
+ **Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.**
+ *AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.*
+ *Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.*

2. Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)
+ **We have access to a lot more data.**
+ **Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.**
+ **We have access to a lot more computational power.**
+ *Neural Networks are a brand new field.*

3. Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)

+ (maybe) Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).
+ (maybe) It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset.
+ **Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.**
+ **Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.**

4. When building a neural network to predict housing price from features like size, the number of bedrooms, zip code, and wealth, it is necessary to come up with other features in between input and output like family size and school quality. True/False?
+ *True*
+ **False**

5. ReLU stands for which of the following?
+ *Recognition Linear Unit*
+ *Representation Linear Unit*
+ **Rectified Linear Unit**
+ *Rectified Last Unit*

6. Features of animals, such as weight, height, and color, are used for classification between cats, dogs, or others. This is an example of "structured" data, because they are represented as arrays in a computer. True/False?
+ **True**
+ *False*

7. A dataset is composed of age and weight data for several people. This dataset is an example of "structured" data because it is represented as an array in a computer. True/False?
+ **True**
+ *False*

8. Why can an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) be used to create English captions to French movies? Choose all that apply
+ *The RNN requires a small number of examples.*
+ **The RNN is applicable since the input and output of the problem are sequences.**
+ maybe RNNs are much more powerful than a Convolutional neural Network (CNN).
+ maybe It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.

9. Suppose the information given in the diagram is accurate. We can deduce that when using large training sets, for a model to keep improving as the amount of data for training grows, the size of the neural network must grow. True/False?

+ **True**
+ *False*

10. Assuming the trends described in the figure are accurate. The performance of a NN depends only on the size of the NN. True/False?

+ *True*
+ **False**
